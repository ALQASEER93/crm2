# CRM Project
This repository contains a simple CRM skeleton with a Node.js/Express backend and a placeholder React frontend.

## Visits Feature Documentation
Detailed API references, dashboard walkthroughs, and seeding instructions for the Visits experience now live in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Review that guide when working on `/api/visits/*` endpoints or testing the Visits Dashboard UI.
